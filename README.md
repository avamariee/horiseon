# Horiseon
## Module 1 Challenge

This code was taken and refactored so it is more accessible.

```
The title was changed to reflect the name of the web page.
Navigation links are now working properly.
HTML elements were changed to contain semantic tags instead of <div>.
Multiple "alts" was added to the images to provide descriptions for screen readers.
CSS selectors were consolidated to remove redundancy and improve readability.
CSS was also re-arranged so it falls in sequential order.
```
